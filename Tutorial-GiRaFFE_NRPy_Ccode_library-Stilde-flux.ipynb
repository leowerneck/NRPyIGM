    "# The Riemann Solution on $\\tilde{S}_i$ using HLLE\n",
    "### Author: Patrick Nelson\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the function from the original `GiRaFFE` that calculates the flux for $\\tilde{S}_i$ according to the method of Harten, Lax, von Leer, and Einfeldt (HLLE), assuming that we have calculated the values of the velocity and magnetic field on the cell faces according to the piecewise-parabolic method (PPM) of [Colella and Woodward (1984)](https://crd.lbl.gov/assets/pubs_presos/AMCS/ANAG/A141984.pdf), modified for the case of GRFFE. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Module Status:** <font color=green><b> Validated against the original `GiRaFFE` </b></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation Notes:** Everything should be written at this point, but we need to finish the rest of the algorithm before we can validate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differential equations that `GiRaFFE` evolves are written in conservation form, and thus have two different terms that contribute to the time evolution of some quantity: the flux term and the source term. The PPM method is what the original `GiRaFFE` uses to handle the flux term; hopefully, using this instead of finite-differencing will fix some of the problems we've been having with `GiRaFFE_HO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In GRFFE, the evolution equation for the Poynting flux $\\tilde{S}_i$ is given as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\\partial_t \\tilde{S}_i + \\underbrace{ \\partial_j \\left( \\alpha \\sqrt{\\gamma} T^j_{{\\rm EM} i} \\right)}_{\\rm Flux\\ term} = \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha \\sqrt{\\gamma} T^{\\mu \\nu}_{\\rm EM} \\partial_i g_{\\mu \\nu}}_{\\rm Source\\ term}.}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We can then see that, if we rewrite this, the right-hand side (RHS) describing the time evolution $\\partial_t \\tilde{S}_i$ consists of two terms: the flux term and the source term. The flux term in particular can be tricky, as it may be discontinuous due to shocks or other sharp features. This presents difficulties when we take finite-difference derivatives of that term, leading to the Gibbs phenomenon. So, we implement a different algorithm to take the derivative. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is the flux term $\\alpha \\sqrt{\\gamma} T^j_{{\\rm EM} i} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\gamma} g_{i \\mu} T^{\\mu i}_{\\rm EM}$ itself that concerns us here, where $T^{\\mu \\nu}_{\\rm EM} = b^2 u^\\mu u^\\nu + \\frac{1}{2} b^2 g^{\\mu \\nu} - b^\\mu b^\\nu$; the following functions will compute this value so that we can easily take its derivative later. Having reconstructed the values of $v^i_{(n)}$ and $B^i$ on the cell faces, we will now compute the value of the flux of $\\tilde{S}_i$ on each face. For each component of $\\tilde{S}_i$ in each direction, we compute the flux as\n",

    "Here, $i$ is direction in which we are computing the flux, and $j$ is the component of the momentum we are computing it for. Note that these two quantities are computed on both the left and right sides of the cell face. We will be able to draw heavily on the module [Tutorial-u0_smallb_Poynting-Cartesian.ipynb](Tutorial-u0_smallb_Poynting-Cartesian.ipynb) to compute $u^0$, $u^i$, and $b^\\mu$, as well as the index-lowered forms of those vectors. Critically, these quantities depend on the Valencia 3-velocity $v^i_{(n)}$ and magnetic field $B^i$. We will not be using the normal gridfunctions for these, but rather the ones that we have previosly calculated on the left and right sides of the cell faces using the [Piecewise Parabolic Method](Tutorial-GiRaFFE_HO_Ccode_library-PPM.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The speeds $c_\\min$ and $c_\\max$ are characteristic speeds that waves can travel through the plasma. In GRFFE, the expressions defining them reduce a function of only the metric quantities. $c_\\min$ is the negative of the minimum amongst the speeds $c_-$ and $0$ and $c_\\max$ is the maximum amongst the speeds $c_+$ and $0$. The speeds $c_\\pm = \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}$ must be calculated on both the left and right faces, where \n",

    "This computes phase speeds in the direction given by flux_dirn. Note that we replace the full dispersion relation with a simpler one, which overestimates the maximum speeds by a factor of ~2. See full discussion around Eqs. 49 and 50 in [Duez, et al.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0503420.pdf). In summary, we solve the dispersion relation (in, e.g., the $x$-direction) with a wave vector of $k_\\mu = (-\\omega,k_x,0,0)$. So, we solve the approximate dispersion relation $\\omega_{\\rm cm}^2 = [v_A^2 + c_s^2 (1-v_A^2)]k_{\\rm cm}^2$ for the wave speed $\\omega/k_x$, where the sound speed $c_s = \\sqrt{\\Gamma P/(h \\rho_0)}$, the Alfv&eacute;n speed $v_A = 1$ (in GRFFE), $\\omega_{\\rm cm} = -k_\\mu k^\\mu$ is the frequency in the comoving frame, $k_{\\rm cm}^2 = K_\\mu K^\\mu$ is the wavenumber squared in the comoving frame, and $K_\\mu = (g_{\\mu\\nu} + u_\\mu u_\\nu)k^\\nu$ is the part of the wave vector normal to the four-velocity $u^\\mu$.
